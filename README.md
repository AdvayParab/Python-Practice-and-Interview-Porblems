## Basics

- **Print "Hello, World"**: The first and simplest Python program.
- **Variables**: Understanding the types and number of variables.
- **Basic Arithmetic and Exponentials**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and power operations.

---

## Control Flow

- **Find Even and Odd Numbers**: Using conditional statements to classify numbers.
- **Leap Year Check**: A program to determine if a year is a leap year.
- **Find the Largest of Three Numbers**: Comparing three values to find the largest.

---

## Data Structures

- **Lists**:
  - Compute the sum of all elements in a list.
  - Calculate the average of a list.
  - Find the maximum element in a list without using built-in functions.
  - Use list comprehensions to create and modify lists.
  - Count occurrences of an element in a list.

- **Tuples**:
  - Swap two variables using tuple unpacking.
  - Unpack tuples to access elements.

- **Dictionaries**:
  - Create a phone book and access phone numbers using names.
  - Count the frequency of words in a dictionary.
  - Merge two dictionaries into one.

---

## Strings

- **Palindrome**: Check if a string is a palindrome.
- **Anagram**: Determine if two strings are anagrams.
- **Reverse a String**: Reverse a string without using slicing or functions.
- **String Length**: Find the length of a string manually.
- **Count Vowels**: Count the number of vowels in a string.

---

## Functions

- **Factorial**: A function to compute the factorial of a number.
- **Fibonacci**: Generate the Fibonacci series using recursion.
- **Prime Number Check**: Verify if a number is prime.
- **GCD and LCM**: Compute the greatest common divisor and least common multiple.

---

## File I/O

- **Read a File**: Open and read the contents of a file.
- **Write to a File**: Create and write data into a file.
- **Copy File**: Copy the contents of one file to another.
- **Count Lines**: Count the number of lines in a file.

---

## Modules and Packages

- **Math Module**:
  - Use mathematical functions like `sqrt`, `factorial`, `cos`, and `log10`.
  - Access mathematical constants like Pi.

- **Random Module**:
  - Generate random integers, floats, and choices.
  - Shuffle lists and create random samples.

- **Datetime Module**:
  - Work with current dates and times.
  - Add or subtract time using `timedelta`.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Classes and Objects**:
  - Create a class with attributes and methods.
  - Instantiate objects and access attributes and methods.

- **Inheritance**:
  - Create child classes that inherit from parent classes.
  - Override parent methods in child classes.

- **Polymorphism**:
  - Demonstrate polymorphism with shared method names in different classes.
  - Use functions to handle objects of various classes uniformly.
